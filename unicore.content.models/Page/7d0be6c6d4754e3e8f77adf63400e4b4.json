To protect food from germs:\r\n\r\n* keep food preparation surfaces clean \r\n* keep knives, cooking utensils, pots\r\nand plates clean and covered \r\n* wash cloths used to clean dishes or pans\r\nthoroughly every day and dry them in the sun. Wash plates, utensils and pans\r\nimmediately after eating and put them on a rack to dry \r\n* keep food in clean,\r\ncovered containers to protect it from insects and animals \r\n* do not use feeding\r\nbottles or teats, because they may contain germs that cause diarrhoea.\r\nBreastfeed, or feed children from a clean, open cup. If bottles/teats are\r\nused, clean them after each use with boiling water.\r\n\r\n",
