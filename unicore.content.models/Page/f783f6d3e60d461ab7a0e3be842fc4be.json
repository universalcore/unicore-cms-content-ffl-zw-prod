  "content": "Breastmilk is a baby's 'first immunization'. It helps to protect against\r\ndiarrhoea, ear and chest infections, and other health problems. The protection\r\nis greatest when breastmilk alone is given for the first six months and when\r\nbreastfeeding continues along with other foods well into the second year and\r\nbeyond. No other milks, foods or supplements can provide the protection of\r\nbreastmilk. \r\n\r\nBreastfeeding helps a mother and baby form a close, loving\r\nrelationship - a process called bonding. The close contact and attention help\r\ninfants feel secure and loved, which is important for their growth and\r\ndevelopment. \r\n\r\nThe father and other family members can help by encouraging the\r\nmother to rest quietly while she breastfeeds the baby. They can also make sure\r\nthe mother has enough nutritious food and help with household tasks and caring\r\nfor older children\r\n\r\n",
