  "content": "A child with diarrhoea loses weight and can quickly become malnourished. A\r\nchild with diarrhoea needs all the foods and fluids, including breastmilk, she\r\nor he can take. Nutritious foods will help the child recover more quickly. \r\n\r\nA child with diarrhoea may not want to eat or may vomit, so feeding can be\r\ndifficult. Breastfeeding should be more frequent. If the child is 6 months of\r\nage or older, parents and other caregivers should encourage the child to eat\r\nas often as possible, offering small amounts of soft, mashed foods or foods\r\nthe child likes. These foods should contain a small amount of salt. Soft foods\r\nare easier to eat and contain more fluid than hard foods. \r\n\r\nRecommended foods\r\nfor a child with diarrhoea are well-mashed mixes of cereals and beans, fish,\r\nwell-cooked meat, yogurt and fruits. A little oil can be added to cereal and\r\nvegetables, about 1 or 2 teaspoons. Foods should be freshly prepared and given\r\nto the child five or six times a day. \r\n\r\nAfter the diarrhoea stops, extra feeding\r\nis vital for a full recovery. At this time, the child needs to be given more\r\nfood than usual, including breastmilk, to help replenish the energy and\r\nnourishment lost due to the diarrhoea. \r\n\r\nA child is not fully recovered from\r\ndiarrhoea until she or he is at least the same weight as when the illness\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n",
