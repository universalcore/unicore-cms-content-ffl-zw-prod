  "content": "All children and their families and communities have the right to receive humanitarian assistance in emergencies.\r\n\r\nChildren and their families who are forced from their homes by conflicts or disasters have the same rights as those living in their homes and communities in non-emergency situations.\r\n\r\nCommunities can designate protected areas to shelter civilians and the sick. These areas must never be used for any military purposes.\r\n\r\nHumanitarian relief workers and supplies must always be respected and protected. Combatants should always allow all civilians access to humanitarian assistance.\r\n\r\nThe particular needs of women and adolescent girls in emergency situations must be respected. Their specific needs of privacy, hygiene and protection must be taken into account. Unaccompanied children, pregnant women, mothers with young children, female heads-of-households, persons with disabilities and the elderly may require specific attention to address their particular needs.\r\n\r\nWhen children and families are displaced within a country, the national authorities have the primary responsibility to protect children's rights and assist children and families. The United Nations, non-governmental organizations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), among others, also have a critical role to play in providing assistance and protection to children and families.\r\n\r\nDisplaced persons have the right to safely return to their homes as soon as the reasons for their displacement are no longer an issue. The property rights of displaced persons must be respected so children and families can rebuild their lives.\r\n\r\nAs communities begin to re-establish and reconstruct after an emergency, attention should be given to providing social services, including health and education, to children, women and families.\r\n\r\nHumanitarian workers who provide aid to civilians should minimize opportunities for violence, exploitation and abuse. Any activity by humanitarian workers that exploits the population should be reported immediately to the agency concerned and the authorities.\r\n",
