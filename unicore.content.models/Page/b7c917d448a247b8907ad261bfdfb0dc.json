During pregnancy and while breastfeeding, all women need more nutritious meals, increased quantities of food, more rest than usual, iron-folic acid or multiple micronutrient supplements, even if they are consuming fortified foods, and iodized salt to ensure the proper mental development of their babies.",

  "content": "Adolescent girls, women, pregnant women and new mothers need the best foods\r\navailable: milk, fresh fruit and vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, grains, peas\r\nand beans. All of these foods are safe to eat during pregnancy and while\r\nbreastfeeding. \r\n\r\nWomen will feel stronger and be healthier during pregnancy if\r\nthey eat nutritious meals, consume greater quantities of nutritious food and\r\nget more rest than usual. Nutritious foods rich in iron, vitamin A and folic\r\nacid include meat, fish, eggs, green leafy vegetables, and orange or yellow\r\nfruits and vegetables. \r\n\r\nAfter childbirth, women also need nutritious meals and\r\na greater quantity of food and rest. Breastfeeding mothers need about 500\r\nextra calories per day, the equivalent of an additional meal. During prenatal\r\nvisits, a trained health worker can provide the pregnant woman with iron-folic\r\nacid or multiple micronutrient supplements to prevent or treat anaemia.\r\nMalaria or hookworm infection can be treated if needed. The health worker can\r\nalso screen the pregnant woman for night blindness and, as necessary,\r\nprescribe an adequate dosage of vitamin A to treat the woman and contribute to\r\nthe healthy development of the fetus. \r\n\r\nIf the pregnant woman thinks she has\r\nanaemia, malaria or hookworms, she should consult a trained health worker.\r\n\r\nSalt consumed by families should be iodized. Iodine in a pregnant woman's and\r\nyoung child's diet is especially critical for the healthy development of the\r\nchild's brain. Goitre, a swelling at the front of the neck, is a clear sign\r\nthat the body is not getting enough iodine. A diet low in iodine is especially\r\ndamaging during the early stages of pregnancy and in early childhood. Women\r\nwho do not have enough iodine in their diet are more likely to have an infant\r\nwho is mentally or physically disabled. Severe iodine deficiency can cause\r\ncretinism (stunted physical and mental growth), stillbirth, miscarriage and\r\nincreased risk of infant mortality.\r\n\r\n",
