  "content": "Every pregnancy deserves attention because there is always a risk of something\r\ngoing wrong with the mother, baby or both. Many dangers, illnesses or even\r\ndeath can be avoided if the woman plans to give birth attended by a skilled\r\nbirth attendant, such as a doctor, nurse or midwife, and makes at least four\r\nprenatal visits to a trained health worker during the pregnancy. \r\n\r\nThe likelihood of the mother or the baby becoming ill or dying is reduced when\r\nchildbirth takes place in a properly equipped health facility with the\r\nassistance of a skilled birth attendant, who also checks regularly on the\r\nmother and baby in the 24 hours after delivery. \r\n\r\nWhen the pregnant woman is\r\nready to give birth, she should be encouraged to have a companion of her\r\nchoice accompany her to provide her with continuous support during childbirth\r\nand after birth. In particular, the companion can support the woman in labour\r\nto eat and drink, use breathing techniques for different stages of childbirth,\r\nand arrange for pain and discomfort relief as needed and advised by the\r\nskilled birth attendant. \r\n\r\n**During and immediately following childbirth, the\r\nskilled birth attendant will:** \r\n\r\n* assess and follow the progress of labour and\r\npay attention to danger signs that indicate help is needed *immediately* \r\n* advise the woman and her family if specialized care is needed and if a\r\ntransfer to a hospital or maternity centre is necessary \r\n* reduce the risk of\r\ninfection by keeping hands, instruments and the delivery area clean, and by\r\nusing gloves at appropriate times \r\n* encourage the woman to walk during the\r\nfirst stage of labour and support her choice of position for childbirth \r\n* assist the different stages of labour and the birth of the baby \r\n* cut the umbilical cord at the appropriate moment and care for it \r\n* care for the baby and keep her or him warm after birth \r\n* guide the mother to put her baby on her\r\nchest for immediate skin-to-skin contact and initiation of breastfeeding soon\r\nafter birth \r\n* deliver the afterbirth (placenta) safely and care for the mother after the baby is born \r\n* examine and weigh the baby and put recommended drops\r\nin the baby's eyes to prevent blindness and infection \r\n* manage newborn health problems and refer or transfer the baby with the mother to an appropriate\r\nhealth provider or health facility, if necessary.\r\n\r\n",
