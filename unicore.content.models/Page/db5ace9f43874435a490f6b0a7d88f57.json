Where soap is not available hands can be washed with ash and water. Animal and human faeces should be kept away from houses, paths, water sources and children\u2019s play areas.\r\n\r\n**The use of latrines and toilets together with good hygiene practices \u2013 specifically hand washing with soap \u2013 are essential public health tools.** They protect children and families at little cost and help realize children\u2019s right to good health and nutrition.\r\n\r\n**Some facts to know about hygiene**\r\n\r\n 1. **All faeces, including those of babies and young children, should be disposed of safely.** Making sure that all family members use a toilet, latrine or potty (for young children) is the best way to dispose of faeces. Where there is no toilet, faeces should be buried.\r\n\r\n 2. **All family members, including children, need to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water** after any contact with faeces, before touching or preparing food, and before feeding children. Where soap is not available, a substitute, such as ash and water, can be used.\r\n\r\n 3. **Washing the face and hands with soap and water every day helps to prevent eye infections.** In some parts of the world, eye infections can lead to trachoma, which can cause blindness.\r\n\r\n 4. **All water that people drink and use should come from a safe source or be purified.** Containers for carrying and storing water need to be kept clean inside and outside and covered to keep the water clean. Where necessary, home-based water treatment, such as boiling, filtering, adding chlorine or disinfecting with sunlight, should be used to purify the water.\r\n\r\n 5. **Raw or leftover cooked food can be dangerous.** Raw food should be washed or cooked. Cooked food should be eaten without delay or thoroughly reheated before eating.\r\n\r\n 6. **Food, utensils and preparation surfaces should be kept clean and away from animals.** Food should be stored in covered containers.\r\n\r\n 7. **Safe disposal of all household refuse** helps to keep the living environment clean and healthy. This helps prevent illness.\r\n\r\n 8. **Hygiene is very important during menstruation.** Clean and dry feminine hygiene products should be available to girls and women. A clean, private space should be provided to allow them to clean themselves and wash and dry their cloths. Sanitary napkins need to be disposed of carefully with other refuse or burned.\r\n\r\nNext article: ",
