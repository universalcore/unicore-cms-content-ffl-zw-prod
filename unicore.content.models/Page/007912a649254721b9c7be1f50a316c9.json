  "content": "Many parents do not take a child to be immunized because the child has a\r\nfever, cough, cold, diarrhoea or some other illness. However, it is safe to\r\nimmunize a child who has a minor illness. \r\n\r\nIt is also safe to immunize a child\r\nwho has a disability or is malnourished. If a child is HIV-positive or\r\nsuspected to be HIV-positive, a trained health worker should be consulted\r\nabout which vaccines to give the child. \r\n\r\nAfter an injection, the child may cry\r\nor develop a fever, a minor rash or a small sore. This is normal and shows\r\nthat the vaccine is working. Children under 6 months of age should breastfeed\r\nfrequently; older children should be given plenty of liquids and foods. If the\r\nchild develops a high fever (over 38 degrees Celsius) the child should be\r\ntaken to a trained health worker or health centre. \r\n\r\nMeasles can be extremely\r\ndangerous for malnourished children, so they should be immunized against\r\nmeasles, especially if the malnutrition is severe.\r\n\r\n",
