  "content": "Households that need income support and social welfare services may be headed by the elderly, widows, children or individuals who are sick or disabled. This can include families affected by HIV.\r\n\r\nIncome support and social welfare services can provide children and families the means to:\r\n\r\n - purchase food\r\n - pay for or access health care and education\r\n - keep families together\r\n - keep children out of institutional care or from working or living on\r\n   the street\r\n - help families break out of the cycle of poverty.\r\n\r\nThe government and local authorities, with support from civil society, can help identify families in need. They can assist families with income support and social welfare services such as counselling and legal aid. It is important to ensure that families do not face discrimination related to accessing or using the services.\r\n\r\nInformation on income support and social welfare services can be provided through various communication channels, including health centres, schools and community centres; during community meetings and events; and through radio and loudspeaker announcements.\r\n",
