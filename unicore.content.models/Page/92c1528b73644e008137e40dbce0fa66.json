  "content": "Poisoning is a serious danger to small children. Bleach, insect and rat poison, paraffin (kerosene) and household detergents can kill or permanently injure a child.\r\n\r\nMany poisons can kill, cause brain damage, blind or permanently injure if they:\r\n\r\n - are swallowed\r\n - are inhaled\r\n - get onto the skin\r\n - get into the eyes.\r\n\r\n**The key to preventing poisoning is to keep harmful substances out of children's reach.**\r\n\r\n - Poisons should never be put in soft drink or beer bottles, jars or\r\n   cups, as children may drink them by mistake. All medicines, chemicals\r\n   and poisons should be stored in their original containers, tightly\r\n   sealed and out of children's reach.\r\n - Detergents, bleaches, chemicals and medicines should never be left\r\n   where children can reach them. They should be tightly sealed and\r\n   labelled. They should also be locked in a cupboard or trunk or put on\r\n   a high shelf where children cannot see or reach them.\r\n - Medicines meant for adults can kill or injure small children.\r\n   Medicine should only be given to a child if it is prescribed for that\r\n   child. It should never be given to a child if it is prescribed for an\r\n   adult or some other child. A child should never take medication on\r\n   his or her own. The parent or other caregiver should give the\r\n   medication to the child each time it is needed. Medication should be\r\n   stored out of reach and sight of children.\r\n - Child-resistant closures, where available, should be used on\r\n   containers storing poisonous substances.\r\n\r\n*For first aid advice on poisoning, refer to the end of this chapter.*\r\n",
