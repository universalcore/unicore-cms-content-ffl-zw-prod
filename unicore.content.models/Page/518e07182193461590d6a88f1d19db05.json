  "content": "Drowning may cause brain injury or death. To prevent children from drowning, parents and other caregivers should always closely supervise children who are near or in the water.'\r\n\r\n**Where there is water, it is important to:**\r\n\r\n - cover wells and water tanks so children cannot open them\r\n - turn tubs and buckets upside down when not in use, and always\r\n   supervise children taking a bath\r\n - teach children to stay away from ditches and drains\r\n - for families who live near bodies of water, install a fence around\r\n   the house and close the gates to prevent young children from going in\r\n   the water\r\n - fence ponds and pools with vertical rails spaced close together to\r\n   prevent children from getting through them to the water\r\n - for families who live directly on the water, put vertical bars on\r\n   terraces, windows and doors to prevent young children from falling in\r\n   the water\r\n - teach children how to swim when they are young\r\n - have young children and children who cannot swim wear an approved\r\n   flotation device (life jacket) when playing in the water or on a boat\r\n - always supervise children who are swimming\r\n - teach children never to swim in fast-flowing streams and never to\r\n   swim alone\r\n - in flood-prone areas, carefully watch children when the water begins\r\n   to rise; make sure that all family members, including children old\r\n   enough to understand, are well informed of safe places to go to if\r\n   they need to leave the home quickly.\r\n\r\n*For first aid advice on drowning, refer to the end of this chapter.*",
