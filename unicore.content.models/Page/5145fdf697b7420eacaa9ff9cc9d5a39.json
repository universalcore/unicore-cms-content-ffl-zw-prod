  "content": "In the first six months, when a baby is most at risk, exclusive breastfeeding\r\nhelps to protect against diarrhoea and other common infections and gets the\r\nbaby off to a good start in life. \r\n\r\nAt 6 months of age, the child needs other\r\nfoods and drinks in addition to breastmilk. These provide energy, protein,\r\nvitamins and other nutrients needed to support growth and development. \r\n\r\nA variety of foods - vegetables and fruits, meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy\r\nproducts - help to meet the child's nutrition needs. Breastfeeding for up to\r\ntwo years and beyond provides an important source of nutrients that protect\r\nagainst disease. \r\n\r\nIf soft, semi-solid or solid foods are introduced too late,\r\nthe child may not be getting the necessary nutrients. This can slow down\r\ngrowth and development. \r\n\r\nWhen introducing solid foods, it is important to start\r\nwith soft, mushy foods and move gradually to more solid foods. The greater the\r\nvariety of healthy foods, the more balanced and nutritious the child's diet.\r\n\r\nThe consistency and variety of foods should be adapted to a child's\r\nrequirements and eating abilities. At 6 months of age infants can eat pureed\r\nor mashed foods, thick soups and porridges. By 8 months most infants can also\r\neat 'finger foods' (snacks that children can eat by themselves). By 12 months,\r\nmost children can eat the same types of foods as the rest of the family.\r\n\r\nParents or other caregivers should avoid giving foods that may cause choking,\r\nsuch as nuts, grapes and raw carrots and other foods that have a shape and/or\r\nconsistency that may cause them to become lodged in the child's throat. \r\n\r\nIt may be difficult to meet all the child's nutrient requirements without a lot of\r\nfoods from animal sources. So it may be necessary to give the child fortified\r\nfoods or spreads or multiple vitamin and mineral supplements, such as powders,\r\nsyrups or dissolvable tablets. A trained health worker can advise the parent\r\nor other caregiver about foods that provide the most nutrients and which\r\nsupplements to use. \r\n\r\n**Following are some nutritious foods for young children (older than six months) to eat:** \r\n\r\n* Staple foods, including cereals (rice,\r\nwheat, maize, millet, quinoa), roots (cassava, yam, potatoes) and starchy\r\nfruits (plantain and breadfruit). \r\n* High-protein foods, such as red meat,\r\npoultry, fish, liver and eggs (can be given as often as possible). \r\n* Dairy products, such as cheese, yogurt, curds and dried milk (which can be mixed\r\nwith other foods, such as cooked porridge). These are good choices in the\r\nsecond six months of a breastfed child's life. These are better choices than\r\nraw milk, which is harder for the child to digest. \r\n* Green leafy and orange-\r\ncoloured vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, chard, carrots, pumpkins and\r\nsweet potatoes (which provide vitamins). \r\n* Pulses, such as chickpeas, lentils,\r\ncowpeas, black-eyed peas, kidney beans and lima beans (to add variety and\r\nprovide protein, energy and some iron). \r\n* Oils, especially rapeseed oil, soy\r\noil, red palm oil, butter or margarine. \r\n* Seeds, including groundnut paste,\r\nother nut pastes and soaked or germinated seeds, such as pumpkin, sunflower,\r\nmelon or sesame seeds (for energy and some vitamins). \r\n\r\nIt is difficult to\r\nprovide all the nutrients needed by young children in a vegetarian diet. This\r\nis because foods from animal sources provide key nutrients, such as iron. A\r\nchild eating a vegetarian diet needs additional nutrients in the form of\r\nmultiple vitamin tablets or powders, fortified spreads or nutrient-rich food\r\nsupplements. \r\n\r\nIron from plant foods is generally not absorbed very well by the\r\nbody. However, plant foods such as pulses (white beans, chickpeas, lentils)\r\nhave more iron. The iron will be better absorbed if eaten together with foods\r\nthat are high in vitamin C, such as oranges and other citrus fruits and\r\njuices.\r\n\r\n",
